# BlueSky Verification - Methodology
In the summer of 2020 I was tasked with completing the task that Tim Atkinson had started several months earlier, verifying BlueSky Canada forecasts in quasi-realtime. The three main parts of the site, which I will describe in detail below, are the individual station verification, the model and observations map, and the statistics. At the moment this is only operational for stations in British Columbia, but the hope is to expand that into Alberta and potentially other provinces if there is interest. 

### **Individual Station Verification**
start with description for users and change it a bit 

### **Statistics**
* #### **Mean Absolute Error**
* #### **Root Absolute Squared Error**
* #### **Hit Rate**
* #### **False Alarm Rate**
* #### **Misses**
* #### **Correct Negatives** 

### **Model and Observations Map**
* #### **Interpretation**
* #### **Spatial and Temporal Window Pairs**

### **How to Run**
* #### **Command Line Flags**
* #### **Required Modules**



Random other things i'm thinking of
