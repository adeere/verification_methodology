      <!-- Intro to Page-->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>This verification webpage is to be used to compare the 
          bluesky forecast with observations, as well as to look at some 
          real-time statistics. There are three main parts to this page,
          the individual station verification, the statistics, and the model and 
          observations map. I will go through each section in detail below, 
          including an explanation of each section and the methodology behind these parts. </p>

        <!-- Verifcation Map Methodology -->
      <a name="verif_maps_method"></a>
      <h2> Verification Map </h2>
      <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p> This is a map showing the absolute difference between PM2.5 in the BlueSky Canada forecast 
        and the PM2.5 observed at stations throughout BC. It can be interpreted as how well the smoke 
        forecast did at observation stations for different windows in time and space, currently in BC. 
        The plots are created with plotly, an interactive graphing tool in python. The sliders give users
        the option to vary the time and spatial windows around the observation points. The scale on the 
        right shows the difference and is split into coloured intervals based on how large the difference
        is. Red indicates that the difference is larger while green indicates that the difference is smaller. </p>
      
      <p>This difference should be interpreted as a better forecast if the absolute difference is smaller 
        (green in colour), and a worse forecast if the absolute difference is greater (red in colour). 
        This page can be helpful to look at how specific areas in BC are going, or specific stations, at
        particular times during the forecast. The DateTime bar below the map can be scrolled, paused, 
        and played to look at a specific time or period of time. </p> 

        
      <p>The time and spatial windows determine the period of time or space that the maps look at. 
        The spatial and time windows determine the spacing around each of the observation points that
        we look at to find the closest match. For example, if the time window is plus or minus 5 
        hours and the spatial window is plus or minus 22 km, to find the closest match to the observations, 
        we look at 5 hours on either side, and 22 km on either side. So, as the spatial and time 
        windows increase, the absolute difference is usually smaller, and the forecasts are interpreted
        as being better. This is useful because for many interpretations of the BlueSky forecast, 
        it doesn’t matter much where exactly the smoke is located. For cities wondering what their
        air quality will be, if the smoke is forecasted 5 km away form where it was observed, 
        it still affects individuals the same.</p>

<!-- Verifcation Statistics Methodology -->
  <a name="verif_stats_method"></a>
      <h2> Verification Statistics</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p>These statistics are useful to analyze how well the forecast has done on any given day. 
        There are 5 statistics shown for each day: the mean absolute error, the root mean squared
        error, the accuracy, the hit rate, and the false alarm rate. To account for background smoke, 
        I set the observations equal to observations - 10 ug/m^3 (observations’ = observations - 10 ug/m^3).
        Forecast values were left the same (Forecast’ = Forecast). There are statics for both all of the 
        stations in British Columbia, as well as split into three zones in British Columbia. The three 
        zones can be seen below: Northern BC, Interior BC, and Southern BC. </p>
  
          <img class="img-fluid" style="width:40%; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="bc_zones.png">

          <p>The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared errors
          (RMSE) are computed with the ‘sklearn.metrics’ (scientific python kit) package in python. 
          To calculate the MAE and the RMSE, I removed any forecast and observation pairs in which 
          the observation’ is less than 0 (observation’ is defined above). The mean absolute squared error 
          looks at the absolute difference between the forecast and the observations, this will tell us 
          if the forecast is over or under-performing. A small MAE suggests that the forecast has done
          well to predict the observations, and a larger MAE suggests that the forecast did not do a good
          job predicting the observations. A MAE of zero would mean that the forecast was perfect in 
          predicting the PM2.5 observations at every point on a given day. The formula used for calculating the MAE is: </p>
          $$ MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum |y - \hat{y}| $$
        
          <p> Where n = total number of data points, &Sigma; = the sum of all of the data points, y&#770 = the forecast value,
          y = the observation values. </p>
          <p>The Root-Mean Squared Error is the standard deviation of the residuals (the forecast errors).
          The RMSE essentially tells you how concentrated the data points are around a line of best fit. 
          The RMSE is is calculated by swearing the residuals, finding the average of the residuals, and 
          then taking the square root of that value. Again, the RMSE is calculated with the ‘sklearn.mettics’ 
          package in python, with the formula below: </p>
            $$ RMSE = \sqrt \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y_i} - y_i)^2}{n} $$ 
            <p>To explain the method behind the hit rate, false alarm rate, correct negatives, and misses, I will present
              the following table: 
            </p>

            <table style="float:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 80%" class="table table-bordered table-striped">
              <th rowspan="2" colspan="2">Contingency Table</th>
              <th colspan="2">Observations' > 0 </th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <td>Yes</td>
              <td>No</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <th rowspan="2">Forecast' > 0</th>
              <td>Yes</td>
              <td>Hits </td>
              <td>False Alarms</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <td>No</td>
              <td> Misses</td>
              <td>Correct Negatives</td>
              </tr>
            </table>

        <p> The three statistics that are showed on the page can be defined as:   
          <ul>
            <li> Accuracy =  [(hits + correct negatives)/total] </li>
              <ul>
                <li> This tells us the fraction of forecasts that were correct overall</li>
              </ul>
              <li> Hit Rate =  [hits/(hits + misses)] </li>
              <ul>
                <li> This tells us the fraction of observed "yes" events that were correctly forecast by location</li>
              </ul>
              <li> False Alarm Rate =  [false alarms/(hits + false alarms)] </li>
              <ul>
                <li> This tells us the fraction of "yes" forecast results that were forecast when there was no smoke observed. </li>
              </ul>
          </ul></p>
    <p> A higher accuracy, a higher hit rate, and a lower false alarm rate mean that the forecast is performing better.</p>
</div>

<!-- Individual Traces Methodology -->
<a name="traces_method"></a>
      <h2> Individual Station Verification</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p>The individual station verification displays the raw observations of PM2.5  and the BlueSky smoke forecast + background 
        PM2.5 at all stations in British Columbia. To account for background PM2.5, 10 μg/m3 is added to the forecast. This value 
        is based on a previous study of 41 stations in Alberta that Rosie Howard (Howard, 2015) had done, where the mean background 
        PM2.5 was found to range between 5 μg/m3 and 11 μg/m3. The observed PM2.5 is taken from recorded values from each station, 
        available from the BC government air quality website. The BlueSky forecast that is displayed on this page is a 9-point grid
        point average of the raw BlueSky forecasts. A 3x3 array of padding is created that surrounds each point in the raw BlueSky 
        data. Then the mean of those 9 points is calculated, this gives the grid point average of BlueSky. </p>
        <p>This section of the site is particularly useful if you are wondering about a specific time, or a particular station. 
          The plots are created with plotly, an interactive graphing tool in python. The individual facet plots can be zoomed
          in by selecting a box of interest, and each plot will be zoomed to the same time range. The facet plots can also be
          scrolled horizontally and vertically to look at particular stations of interest.
