        <h1>BlueSky Verification - Methodology</h1>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <p>This verification webpage is to be used to compare the 
          bluesky forecast with observations, as well as to look at some 
          real-time statistics. There are three main parts to this page,
           the individual station verification, the statistics, and the model and 
           observations map. I will go through each section in detail below, 
           including an explanation of each section and the methodology behind these parts. </p>

      <h2> Verification Map </h2>
      <p> This is a map showing the absolute difference between PM2.5 in the BlueSky Canada forecast 
        and the PM2.5 observed at stations throughout BC. It can be interpreted as how well the smoke 
        forecast did at observation stations for different windows in time and space, currently in BC.
        The sliders give users the option to vary the time and spatial windows around the observation
        points. The scale on the right shows the difference and is split into coloured intervals based
        on how large the difference is. Red indicates that the difference is larger while green 
        indicates that the difference is smaller. </p>
      
        <p>This difference should be interpreted as a better forecast if the absolute difference is smaller 
          (green in colour), and a worse forecast if the absolute difference is greater (red in colour). 
          This page can be helpful to look at how specific areas in BC are going, or specific stations, at
          particular times during the forecast. The DateTime bar below the map can be scrolled, paused, 
          and played to look at a specific time or period of time. </p> 

        
      <p>The time and spatial windows determine the period of time or space that the maps look at. 
      The spatial and time windows determine the spacing around each of the observation points that
      we look at to find the closest match. For example, if the time window is plus or minus 5 
      hours and the spatial window is plus or minus 22 km, to find the closest match to the observations, 
      we look at 5 hours on either side, and 22 km on either side. So, as the spatial and time 
      windows increase, the absolute difference is usually smaller, and the forecasts are interpreted
      as being better. This is useful because for many interpretations of the BlueSky forecast, 
      it doesn’t matter much where exactly the smoke is located. For cities wondering what their
      air quality will be, if the smoke is forecasted 5 km away form where it was observed, 
      it still affects individuals the same.</p>

      <h2> Individual Station Verification</h2>
      <p>The individual station verification displays the raw observations of PM2.5
        and the BlueSky smoke forecast + background PM2.5 at all stations in 
        British Columbia. This section of the site is particularly useful if you 
        are wondering about a specific time, or a particular station. The individual
         facet plots can be zoomed by selecting a box of interest, each plot will be
          zoomed to the same time range and range of fine particulate matter. To account 
          for background PM2.5, 10 μg/m3 is added to the forecast. This value is based 
          on a previous study of 41 stations in Alberta that Rosie Howard (Howard, 2015)
           had done, where the mean background PM2.5 was found to range between 5 μg/m3 
           and 11 μg/m3. This is a pretty cut and dry way of doing it, and it could 
           potentially use some improvement. The BlueSky forecast that is displayed 
           on this page is a 9-point grid point average of the raw BlueSky observations. 
           To calculate the 9-point grid point average, a 3x3 array of padding is 
           created that surrounds each point in the raw bluesky data. Then the mean of 
           those 9 points is calculated, this gives the grid point average of BlueSky.  </p>

      <h2> Verification Statistics</h2>
      <p>These statistics are useful to analyze how well the forecast has done on any given day. 
        There are 5 statistics shown for each day: the mean absolute error, the root mean squared
         error, the accuracy, the hit rate, and the false alarm rate. </p>

        <p>There are statics for both all of the stations in British Columbia, as well as split 
          into three zones in British Columbia. The three zones can be seen below: Northern BC, 
          Interior BC, and Southern BC. </p>
  
          <img style="width:40%" src="bc_zones.png">
          <p>The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared errors
           (RMSE) are computed with the ‘sklearn.metrics’ (scientific python kit) package in python. 
           The mean absolute squared error looks at the absolute difference between the forecast 
           and the observations, this will tell us if the forecast is over or under-performing. 
           A small MAE suggests that the forecast has done well to predict the observations, and
            a larger MAE suggests that the forecast did not do a good job predicting the observations. 
            A MAE of zero would mean that the forecast was perfect in predicting the PM2.5 observations
             at every point on a given day. The formula used for calculating the MAE is: </p>
             $$ MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum |y - \hat{y}| $$
             <p>The Root-Mean Squared Error is the standard deviation of the residuals (the forecast errors).
                The RMSE essentially tells you how concentrated the data points are around a line of best fit. 
                The RMSE is is calculated by swearing the residuals, finding the average of the residuals, and 
                then taking the square root of that value. Again, the RMSE is calculated with the ‘sklearn.mettics’ 
                package in python, with the formula below: </p>
            $$ RMSE = \sqrt \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y_i} - y_i)^2}{n} $$
